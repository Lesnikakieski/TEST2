    <p class="intro">
        The Internet of Things (IoT) describes physical objects that are embedded with sensors,
         processing ability, software, and other technologies. That allows them to connect and exchange data 
         with other devices and systems over the internet or other communication networks.
        The IoT encompasses electronics, communication, and computer science engineering. 
        "Internet of Things" has been considered a misnomer because devices do not need to 
        be connected to the public internet. The only requirement is that they only need to be connected to a network and 
        be individually addressable.

      <h3>Industrial Internet of Things</h3>
      <p> sensors, instruments, and other devices networked together with computers' 
        industrial applications, including manufacturing and energy management. This 
        connectivity allows for data collection, exchange, and analysis, potentially 
        facilitating improvements in productivity and efficiency as well as other economic 
        benefits.</p>

      <h3>Patient Monitoring System</h3>
      <p>An IoT-based remote patient monitoring system operates by collecting real-time health
         data from patients using IoT-enabled devices, such as wearable devices and sensors.
          These devices continuously monitor vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure,
           glucose levels, and more.</p>
